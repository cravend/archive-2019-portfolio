      I’ve been incredibly blessed with the opportunities that I’ve had during
      my time in high school. These opportunities have helped me learn more
      about the STEM fields and have helped me realize that I want to study
      computer science. Below is a collection of internships, projects, and
      other experiences that have helped shape my decision to study in this
      field.
